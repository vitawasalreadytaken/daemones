Starting/Stopping Daemons As a Non-Root User
============================================

Unless you are running your desktop as root (and that's one hell of a bad idea) you
will probably not have permissions to start/stop daemons. Unless you want to do some
SUID magic with the executables (and that's one hell of a bad idea) you should
use sudo or su.



* Option I: sudo, no password

Run "sudo visudo" and add something like this at the end of the file:

zephyr ALL = (root) NOPASSWD: /etc/init.d/apache2, /etc/init.d/mysql, /etc/init.d/postgresql-8.3

List all the executables you need and don't forget to change "zephyr" to your user name.
The configuration basically means that every time you run "sudo one-of-your-daemons" you
won't be asked for password.

Prefix your start/stop commands in the ~/.daemones config with "sudo" and you're done.
You may have noticed that the example configuration assumes this case.



* Option II: gksu/gksudo

Prefix your start/stop commands in the ~/.daemones config with "gksu" or "gksudo".
Every time you use daemones to start/stop a daemon, you will be asked for password.
